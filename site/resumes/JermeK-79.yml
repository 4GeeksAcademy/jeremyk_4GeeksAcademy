    summary: |
      I’m a botanist and educator passionate about connecting science, conservation, coding, 
      and public engagement. With a Ph.D. in Environmental & Plant Biology, I focus on systematics, 
      ecology, evolution, and conservation genetics to better understand and protect biodiversity in 
      the U.S. and beyond. I’ve taught and mentored undergraduate and graduate students for years, 
      created data-driven curricula, and led field-based research initiatives. As director of a conservation 
      center and herbarium, I worked to document plant diversity while developing tools—such as websites 
      and data visualizations—to help the public better understand human impacts on the environment. 
      I’m also expanding my experience in coding and computational tools to enhance my research and teaching. 
      Above all, I’m driven by a commitment to empower the next generation through science, technology, and 
      a deeper connection to nature.

      time: 2009 - 2013
      details: |
        During my Ph.D. in Environmental & Plant Biology, I focused on plant systematics and evolutionary 
        biology. My research combined morphological, anatomical, and molecular data to investigate species 
        relationships and reproductive patterns within an evolutionary framework. I used computational tools 
        like R for data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns of diversification and species 
        boundaries. My primary work centered on the Neotropical African violet genera (Gloxiniinae, Gesneriaceae).

      time: 2007 - 2011
      details: |
       For my master’s degree, I focused on plant ecology and population biology. My research 
       explored how environmental factors influence ecological strategies in native plant 
       species, combining fieldwork with lab-based analyses to better understand plant 
       interactions and population dynamics. I gained experience in experimental design, 
       statistical analysis, and ecological modeling, which laid the foundation for my later 
       work in systematics and conservation.

# Your previous job experiences or volunteer
experiences:
    - role: Associate Professor of Biology
      time: 2015 - 2025
      company: Glenville State College
  
      details: |
        At Glenville State, I served as a faculty member responsible for teaching 
        courses in ecology, evolution, genetics, and organismal biology. I 
        developed and led both introductory and advanced classes, including General
        Botany, Experimental Design, and Conservation Biology, with a strong focus 
        on active learning and data-driven inquiry. I co-led a major curriculum 
        realignment to better align with Vision and Change, which included the 
        creation of new genetics courses and updates to our evolution curriculum. 
        I also directed the campus herbarium and conservation center, overseeing 
        collections management, student research, and public outreach. My time at 
        Glenville allowed me to mentor students closely, support undergraduate 
        research, and advocate for the role of conservation and biodiversity in 
        undergraduate education.
